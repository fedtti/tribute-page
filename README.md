# Tribute Page • freeCodeCamp



## Installing

You don’t need to install this project at all, if you just want to have a look at [the live preview](https://codepen.io/fedtti/full/jXpKON).

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)

Gulp CLI is required to run the preview site _and/or_ to start the development environment.

```
npm i -g gulp-cli
git co https://github.com/fedtti/tribute-page
cd tribute-page/
npm i
gulp
```

Please, notice that `fsevents` only works on macOS: it doesn’t break any dependency – despite the given error – on other platforms.
